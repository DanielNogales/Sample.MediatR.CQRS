CQRS with MediatR in ASP.NET Core 3.1

> CQRS, Command Query Responsibility Segregation is a design pattern that separates the read and write operations of a data source.
Here Command refers to a Database Command, which can be either an Insert / Update or Delete Operation, whereas Query stands for Querying data from a source.
It essentially separates the concerns in terms of reading and writing, which makes quite a lot of sense.
This pattern was originated from the Command and Query Separation Principle devised by Bertrand Meyer.
